---------------------------- introduction ---------------------------------

* Deep learning is considered a subfield of machine learning
* In practice, deep learning is the scaling up of computational structures called neural networks.
* It is important to keep in mind that deep learning is all about learning powerful representations
* There is a huge shift from extracting features to learning features, and that is what deep learning is all about.
* Deep learning has already transformed a variety of businesses such as web search, augmented reality, social networks, automobiles, retail, cybersecurity, and manufacturing. 
* You will learn to formulate problems in terms of machine and deep learning
* Secondly, you will learn the most basic components that tackle some of the following tasks:

		Image classification
		Time series prediction
		Image denoising and compression
		Image generation
		Machine translation
		Graph and node classification
