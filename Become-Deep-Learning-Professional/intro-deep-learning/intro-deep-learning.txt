---------------------------- introduction ---------------------------------

* Deep learning is considered a subfield of machine learning
* In practice, deep learning is the scaling up of computational structures called neural networks.
* It is important to keep in mind that deep learning is all about learning powerful representations
* There is a huge shift from extracting features to learning features, and that is what deep learning is all about.
* Deep learning has already transformed a variety of businesses such as web search, augmented reality, social networks, automobiles, retail, cybersecurity, and manufacturing. 
* You will learn to formulate problems in terms of machine and deep learning
* Secondly, you will learn the most basic components that tackle some of the following tasks:

		Image classification
		Time series prediction
		Image denoising and compression
		Image generation
		Machine translation
		Graph and node classification


========================================== Neural Networks ===============================================

Deep vs neural:
	* Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. It's the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three

Vector:
	* Definition of a vector. A vector is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction. Geometrically, we can picture a vector as a directed line segment, whose length is the magnitude of the vector and with an arrow indicating the direction. The direction of the vector is from its tail to its head.

matrix:
	* matrix, a set of numbers arranged in rows and columns so as to form a rectangular array.

Tensor:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor.
	a mathematical object analogous to but more general than a vector, represented by an array of components that are functions of the coordinates of a space.

Linear Classifiers:

	* nn.Linear(n,m) is a module that creates single layer feed forward network with n inputs and m output. Mathematically, this module is designed to calculate the linear equation Ax = b where x is input, b is output, A is weight. This is where the name 'Linear' came from.
