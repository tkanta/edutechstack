Uninstalling the Chart:
	To uninstall/delete the my-release deployment:

	helm delete my-release
	The command removes all the Kubernetes components but PVC's associated with the chart and deletes the release.

	To delete the PVC's associated with my-release:

	kubectl delete pvc -l release=my-release
	Note: Deleting the PVC's will delete postgresql data as well. Please be cautious before doing it.
