Graph implementation can be done
	- Adjacency Matrix ( efficient when dealing with vertices)
	- Adjacency List (efficient when dealing with edges)


Bipartite Graph:
	 A Bipartite Graph is a special kind of Graph, in which the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that no vertex of U is adjacent to any other vertex in U and no vertex of V is adjacent to any other vertex in V. Vertices in U have edges that connect it to vertices in V
