Heap:
	- A heap must be  a complete binary tree, where nodes at the last level must be structured in such a way that the left side is never empty.
	- A Complete Binary Tree is a tree where each node has a max of two children and nodes at all levels are completely filled (except the leaf nodes)
	- The nodes must be ordered according to the Heap Property.
	- A heap is not sorted but the root element is largest/smallest than all other elements as per maxheap/minheap rule.
	- In Array of complete BTree, (HeapSize-1)/2 is equal to number of all parent nodes
	- In Array of complete BTree, nodeIndex*2+1 = left Child, nodeIndex*2+2 = Right Child.

Differernt Types of Heaps:
	- Binary Heaps
	- Binomial Heaps
	- Fibonacci	Heaps

Reason for using Heap:
	- used in (Graph, Priority Queue, Heapsort)
	- Heap is space efficient as it uses Array
	- To find the top K smallest and largest elements in an Array.
	- Priority queues can be efficiently implemented using Binary Heaps
	- Heap-implemented priority queues are used in Graph algorithms like Prim’s Algorithm and Dijkstra’s algorithm
	- Heap is also used in Graph
	- Heap is used in Heapsort
		* Heapsort worst case (insert/delete) is better than Treesort worst case.
		* HeapSort is especially useful for sorting arrays because Heaps, unlike almost all other types of trees - are usually implemented in arrays, not as linked data structures!
		* Each insert() and delete() operation is O(logN). At the very worst - the heap does not always have all N values in it, so the complexity is certainly no greater than O(NlogN). This is better than the worst-case for TreeSort, which–because you might build a degenerate Binary Search Tree-- is O(N*N)

Priority Queue:	
	- What is priority QUeue
		* https://www.programiz.com/dsa/priority-queue#:~:text=A%20priority%20queue%20is%20a,their%20order%20in%20the%20queue.
	- Priority Queue vs Queue
		* In a queue, the first-in-first-out rule is implemented whereas, in a priority queue, the values are removed on the basis of priority. The element with the highest priority is removed first.
	- Priority Queue Applications
		Some of the applications of a priority queue are:
			Dijkstra's algorithm (shortest paths between nodes in a graph)
			for implementing stack
			for load balancing and interrupt handling in an operating system
			for data compression in Huffman code

--------------- Conver MaxHeap to MinHeap --------------

MaxHeap : [9,4,7,1,-2,6,5];

MinHeap : [-2,1,5,9,4,6,7]


------------------- MinHeap ---------------------------

- A Min Heap follows the Min Heap property, which means the key at the parent node is always smaller than keys at both children nodes.
- The overall time complexity of building the Heap in a Min Heap is the same in as a Max Heap: O(n)- Priority Queue vs Queue
