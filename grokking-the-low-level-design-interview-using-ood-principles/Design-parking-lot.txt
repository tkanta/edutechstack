============================= Getting Ready ================================

* Payment flexibility
* Parking spot type
* Vehicle types
* Pricing
* Design approach 
	We are going to design this parking lot system using the bottom-up design approach. For this purpose, we will follow the steps below:
	Identify and design the smallest components first, like, the vehicle and parking spot types.
	Use these small components to design bigger components, for example, the payment system at the exit.
	Repeat the steps above until we design the whole system like the parking lot.


* Design pattern
	It is always a good practice to discuss the design patterns that a parking lot system falls under.

============================ Requirement ====================================		

Requirements collection
Letâ€™s define the requirements for the parking lot problem:

R1: The parking lot should have the capacity to park 40,000 vehicles.
R2: The four different types of parking spots are handicapped, compact, large, and motorcycle.
R3: The parking lot should have multiple entrance and exit points.
R4: Four types of vehicles should be allowed to park in the parking lot, which are as follows:

	Car
	Truck
	Van
	Motorcycle

R5: The parking lot should have a display board that shows free parking spots for each parking spot type.
R6: The system should not allow more vehicles in the parking lot if the maximum capacity (40,000) is reached.
R7: If the parking lot is completely occupied, the system should show a message on the entrance and on the parking lot display board.
R8: Customers should be able to collect a parking ticket from the entrance and pay at the exit.
R9: The customer can pay for the ticket either with an automated exit panel or pay the parking agent at the exit.
R10: The payment should be calculated at an hourly rate.
R11: Payment can be made using either a credit/debit card or cash.
