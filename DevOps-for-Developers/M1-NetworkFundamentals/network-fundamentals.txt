Horizontal Layers in Networks:
	- Note that each layer at the sending end has a parallel in the receiving end

Independent Evolution in Networks:
	- Any lower layer in this model provides certain services that the upper layer can build other services upon

Encapsulation & Decapsulation:	
	- Each layer adds its own header to the message coming from above and the receiving entity on the other end removes it.


---------------- Application Layer -----------------------
	
http vs websocket : 
	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16945345/differences-between-tcp-sockets-and-web-sockets-one-more-time. 
		* WebSocket is basically an application layer protocol like http (with reference to the ISO/OSI network stack), message-oriented, which makes use of TCP as transport layer.

Push based mechanism	
	- Ajax polling (pull and push)
	- Ajax Long polling (Bayeux Protocol)
	- websocket
	- Html5 Event source and Server send event		
	- Streaming over http 
		* This is made possible with HTML5 and a JavaScript Stream API

process communication:
	Furthermore, server processes need to have well defined and fixed port numbers so that clients can connect to them in a systematic and predictable way. However, clients donâ€™t need to have reserved ports. They can use ephemeral ports. Servers can also use ephemeral ports in addition to the reserved ones. For instance, a client makes the initial connection to the server on a well-known port and the rest of the communication is carried out by connecting to an ephemeral port on the server.

	What does cURL stand for? Client URL

Etag: 
	This mechanism allows caches to be more efficient and saves bandwidth, as a Web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed. ETags can also be used for optimistic concurrency control[1] to help prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other.
