----------------- Ingress -------------------------

- Ingress objects manage external access to the applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster.

- Ingress provides forwarding rules based on paths and domains, SSL termination and a number of other features.

- In a more traditional setup, weâ€™d probably use an external proxy and a load balancer. Ingress provides an API that allows us to accomplish these things, in addition to a few other features we expect from a dynamic cluster.
