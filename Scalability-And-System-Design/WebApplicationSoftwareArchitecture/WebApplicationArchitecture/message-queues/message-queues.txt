======================== Message Queue ===========================

* A message queue, as the name says, is a queue that routes messages from the source to the destination or the sender to the receiver following the FIFO (First in, first out) policy.

* While routing messages through the queue, we can define several rules based on our business requirements. Adding priority to the messages is one that I pointed out


======================= Pub-Sub Message Models ===============

* A publish-subscribe model, aka pub-sub, is a model that enables a single or multiple producers to broadcast messages to multiple consumers.
* There are different types of exchanges available in message queues, some of which are: direct, topic, headers, and fanout. Each exchange type has specific functionality and a use case
* The relationship between the exchange and the queue is known as binding.
* The fanout exchange will fit best for implementing a pub-sub pattern. It will push the messages to the queue and the consumers will receive the message broadcast


======================= Point-to-Point Model ===================

- There are two popular protocols when working with message queues: AMQP Advanced Message Queue Protocol and STOMP Simple or Streaming Text Oriented Message Protocol.

- Every messaging technology, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Apache Kafka, will have its own implementations of these protocols.

Transcoding is the process of converting an audio or video file from one encoding format to another in order to increase the number of compatible target devices a media file can be played on.
