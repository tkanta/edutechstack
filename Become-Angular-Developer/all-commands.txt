===================== CLI commands ===========================

* npx browserslist 
	-  following command to get the list of browsers the configuration will support

* ng generate component post
	- This will generate the four files necessary for a component. In the src/app directory, there will be a new directory, called post, with four files called post.component.ts, post.component.html, post.component.css, and post.component.spec.ts.
	- Invoke it inside root folder and angular will autometically creates it inside src/app folder


==================== Form Submission prevent default =================================

* If the form is submitted, we’ll run a function called onSubmit(). Every time we listen to an event, we’ll be provided an object called $event. The $event object is the regular event object in JavaScript. We’re passing it to the function because we want to be able to stop the default behavior of refreshing the page.

onSubmit(e: Event) {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.toggleModal = !this.toggleModal;
  }



====================== Angular lifecycle hooks: ===================

https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks	

ngOnInit(): This gets called when the component is initialized. We’ll have access to the component’s properties and methods. This includes the element.
ngOnDestroy(): This gets called before Angular destroys (removes) a component. (e.g.: when we navigate to a different route).
ngOnChanges(): This gets called whenever any of the properties of the component is updated. This includes data passed down from the parent component.
