Quartiles:
-----------
Quartiles are three values that split sorted data into four parts, each with an equal number of observations. Quartiles are a type of quantile. 


Happy Number:
---------------
- create slow and fast pointer
- calculate sum of squares of digits of a number
- Iterate till fast number is (!= 1) and (!= slow)
- if fast number converges to 1, it is a happy number otherwise its a non-happy number

====================== Fast and Slow Pointers: Introduction =========================

probelms
	- Find the middle node of a Linked List
	- Determine if a Integer is a happy number

Does my problem match this pattern?
	Either as an intermediate step, or as the final solution, the problem requires identifying:
	- the first x% of the elements in a linked list, or,
	- the element at the k-way point in a linked list, for example, the middle element, or the element at the start of the second quartile, etc.
	- the kth last element in a linked list

What is logarithm:
	- https://byjus.com/maths/logarithms/
	In Mathematics, logarithms are the other way of writing the exponents. A logarithm of a number with a base is equal to another number. A logarithm is just the opposite function of exponentiation. For example, if 10^2 = 100 then log10 100 = 2.

	Hence, we can conclude that, 
	Logb x = n  or   bn = x	
	This can be read as “Logarithm of x to the base b is equal to n”.

Time complexity:
	We have to take the largest number in each n digit number( e.g 2 digit number 99), the time complexity of this function is O(logn), because the number of digits in the number n is log n base 10
