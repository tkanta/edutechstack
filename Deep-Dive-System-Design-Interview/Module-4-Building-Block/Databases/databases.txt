- Note: According to a source, the World Data Center for Climate (WDCC) is the largest database in the world. It contains around 220 terabytes of web data and 6 petabytes of additional data.



-------------- SQL DB ---------------------------

Cons:
	- predetermined schema
	- Impedance mismatch is the difference between the relational model and the in-memory data structures. The relational model organizes data into a tabular structure with relations and tuples. The case is different for in-memory, where a complex data structure can be stored. To make the complex structures compatible with the relations, we would need a translation of the data in light of relational algebra

--------------- NSQL DB ------------------------

- dynamic schema
-  Google’s Cloud Spanner is one such database that’s geo-replicated with automatic horizontal sharding ability and high-speed global snapshots of data.


-------------- Data Replication ----------------------
