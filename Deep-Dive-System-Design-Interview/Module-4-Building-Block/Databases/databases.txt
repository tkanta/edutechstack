- Note: According to a source, the World Data Center for Climate (WDCC) is the largest database in the world. It contains around 220 terabytes of web data and 6 petabytes of additional data.



-------------- SQL DB ---------------------------

Cons:
	- predetermined schema
	- Impedance mismatch is the difference between the relational model and the in-memory data structures. The relational model organizes data into a tabular structure with relations and tuples. The case is different for in-memory, where a complex data structure can be stored. To make the complex structures compatible with the relations, we would need a translation of the data in light of relational algebra

--------------- NSQL DB ------------------------

- dynamic schema
-  Google’s Cloud Spanner is one such database that’s geo-replicated with automatic horizontal sharding ability and high-speed global snapshots of data.


------------- TYpes of databases --------------------------

Relational:
	Pros:
		* One of the greatest powers of the relational database is its abstractions of ACID transactions and related programming semantics
		* DDL even allows us to modify schema while other queries are happening and the database server is running.
		* One of the biggest advantages of the relational database is that it eliminates data redundancy
		* Concurrency in a relational database is handled through transactional access to the data
		* The process of aggregating data from multiple sources is a common practice in enterprise applications. A common way to perform this aggregation is to integrate a shared database where multiple applications store their data. This way, all the applications can easily access each other’s data while the concurrency control measures handle the access of multiple applications.
		* The export and import operations make backup and restoration easier. Most cloud-based relational databases perform continuous mirroring to avoid loss of data and make the restoration process easier and quicker
