-------------------- partitioning --------------------------

* One of the primary mechanisms of achieving scalability is partitioning.
* 2 types of partitioning
	- Vertical
		** Vertical partitioning involves splitting a table into multiple tables with fewer columns and using additional tables to store columns that relate rows across tables. We commonly refer to this as a join operation. We can then store these different tables in different nodes. Normalization is one way to perform vertical partitioning. However, general vertical partitioning goes far beyond that: it splits a column, even when they are normalized.
	- Horizontal (sharding)
		** Horizontal partitioning involves splitting a table into multiple, smaller tables, where each table contains a percentage of the initial table’s rows. We can then store these different sub-tables in different nodes.In a horizontally partitioned system, we can usually avoid accessing data from multiple nodes because all the data for each row is located in the same node. However, we may still need to access data from multiple nodes for requests that are searching for a range of rows that belong to multiple nodes.Another important implication of horizontal partitioning is the potential for loss of transactional semantics.

* Another important implication of horizontal partitioning is the potential for loss of transactional semantics.When we store data in a single machine, we can easily perform multiple operations in an atomic way, where either all or none of them succeed. However, this is much harder to achieve in a distributed system.		

* Vertical partitioning is mainly a data modeling practice, which can be performed by the engineers designing a system—sometimes independently of the storage systems used. However, horizontal partitioning is a common feature of distributed databases. So, to use these systems properly, engineers need to know how the system works under the hood. Therefore, we will mostly focus on horizontal partitioning.

----------- Algorithms for Horizontal Partitioning ------------

* Different types of partitioning
	- range 
	- hash
		Advantage:
			* The ability to calculate the partitioning mapping at runtime with no need to store and maintain the mapping. This is beneficial both in terms of data storage needs and performance, as we don’t need any additional requests to find the mapping
			* A greater chance that the hash function will uniformly distribute the data across our system’s nodes, and prevent some nodes from overloading
		Disadvantage:
			* The inability to perform range queries at all—even for the attribute we use as a partitioning key—without storing additional data or querying all the nodes
			* Adding or removing nodes from the system causes it to re-partition. This results in significant data movement across all nodes of the system

	- consistent hash
			------ Adv ----------
			* Consistent hashing is a partitioning technique that is very similar to hash partitioning, but solves the increased data movement problem caused by hash partitioning.
			* Reduced data movement when nodes are added or removed in the system
			--- disadvantage -------
			* The potential for the data’s non-uniform distribution because of the random assignment of nodes in the ring
			* The potential for more imbalanced data distribution as nodes are added or removed. E.g., a node’s dataset is not distributed evenly across the system when it is removed but is instead transferred to a single node

			Logic:
				- Randomly assigned a number to each node in the range [0, 360]
				- Calculate the mod key % 360
				- Assign the key to the node that is greater than the mod value

-------------------------------- Replication ------------------------------------------------------

There are 2 types of replication:
	- Pessimistic replication tries to guarantee from the beginning that all the replicas are identical to each other—as if there was only one copy of the data all along.
	- Optimistic replication, or lazy replication, allows the different replicas to diverge. This guarantees that they will converge again if the system does not receive any updates, or enters a quiesced state, for a period of time.

Single-Master Replication Algorithm:
	* Single-master replication is a technique where we designate a single node amongst the replicas as the leader, or primary, that receives all the updates.
	* Synchronous replication -> In synchronous replication, the node replies to the client to indicate the update is complete—only after receiving acknowledgments from the other replicas that they’ve also performed the update on their local storage. 
	* Asynchronous replication -> the node replies to the client as soon as it performs the update in its local storage, without waiting for responses from the other replicas.
	* Most widely used databases, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, use a single-master replication technique that supports both asynchronous and synchronous replication.		
	* Advantages of single-master replication
		- It is simple to understand and implement
		- Concurrent operations serialized in the leader node, remove the need for more complicated, distributed concurrency protocols. In general, this property also makes it easier to support transactional operations
		- It is scalable for read-heavy workloads, because the capacity for reading requests can be increased by adding more read replicas
		
	* Disadvantages of single-master replication
		- It is not very scalable for write-heavy workloads, because a single node (the leader)’s capacity determines the capacity for writes
		- It imposes an obvious trade-off between performance, durability, and consistency
		- Scaling the read capacity by adding more follower nodes can create a bottleneck in the network bandwidth of the leader node, if there’s a large number of followers listening for updates
		- The process of failing over to a follower node when the leader node crashes, is not instant. This may create some downtime and also introduce the risk of errors	

Multi-Master Replication Algorithm:
	* Multi-master replication is an alternative replication technique that favors higher availability and performance over data consistency.
	* Approaches to conflict resolution
		- Exposing conflict resolution to the clients#
		- Last-write-wins conflict resolution
		- Causality tracking algorithms#

Quorums in Distributed Systems:
	* The main pattern we’ve seen so far is this: writes are performed to all the replica nodes, while reads are performed to one of them. When we ensure that writes are performed to all of them synchronously before replying to the client
	
	* Availability is quite low for write operations, because the failure of a single node makes the system unable to process writes until the node recovers.
	
	* To solve this problem, we can use the reverse strategy. That is, we write data only to the node that is responsible for processing a write operation, but process read operations by reading from all the nodes and returning the latest value.
	
	* A useful mechanism to achieve a balance in this trade-off is to use quorums.Let’s consider an example. In a system of three replicas, we can say that writes need to complete in two nodes (as a quorum of two), while reads need to retrieve data from two nodes. This way, we can be sure that the reads will read the latest value. This is because at least one of the nodes in the read quorum will also be included in the latest write quorum.

	* The concept of a quorum is used extensively in other areas, like distributed transactions or consensus protocols.

Safety Guarantees in Distributed Systems:
	* The main safety guarantees that systems provide are around the three properties shown in the illustration.
	* The concepts of atomicity and isolation originate from database research and ACID transactions. When we mention consistency in this course, we will mostly refer to the notion of consistency made popular by the CAP theorem.


ACID Transaction:
	
	* Atomicity (A) : Atomicity guarantees that a transaction that comprises multiple operations is treated as a single unit. This means that either all operations of the transaction are executed or none of them are.	
	
	* Consistency (C) : Consistency guarantees that a transaction only transitions the database from one valid state to another valid state, while maintaining any database invariants.	An invariant is a value or condition that is expected to be consistent during the execution of a process.For example, consider an application that has a table A with records that refer to records in table B through a foreign key relationship. The database prevents a transaction from deleting a record from table A, unless any records in table B referenced from this record are already deleted.
	
	* Isolation (I) : Isolation guarantees that even though transactions might run concurrently and have data dependencies, the result is as if one of them was executed at a time and there was no interference between them
	
	* Durability (D) : Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, it remains committed even in the case of failure.

CAP Theorem:
	* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACELC_theorem
	* These sub-categories are combined to form the following four categories: 
			AP/EL
			CP/EL
			AP/EC
			CP/EC	
    * Example: The default versions of Amazon's early (internal) Dynamo, Cassandra, Riak, and Cosmos DB are PA/EL systems: if a partition occurs, they give up consistency for availability, and under normal operation they give up consistency for lower latency.

Consistency Models:
	* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model
	* There are many different consistency models used across the modern system design field. We will focus on the most fundamental ones. These are the following:

		Linearizability
		Sequential Consistency
		Causal Consistency
		Eventual Consistency    

CAP Theorem's Consistency Model:
	* Two commonly supported consistency models
		Considering the guarantees provided by several popular distributed systems nowadays (i.e., Apache Cassandra, DynamoDB, etc.), two models are commonly supported.

		-Strong consistency, specifically linearizability
		-Weak consistency, specifically eventual consistency

Isolation Levels and Anomalies:
	* Subsequent research examines more anomalies extensively and attempts a stricter definition of these levels. The basic parts will be covered in this lesson, but please refer to this paper for a deeper analysis.
